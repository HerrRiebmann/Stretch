# Stretch
Garmin MonkeyC App

###Application area:
Stretching is only effective, from about 30 seconds upwards.
To prevent contantly looking onto the watch, a timer will let you know when you can change the side.
Another timer allows you to change your position.

###Usage:
Start/Stop the timer by pressing "Enter" or "Start".
In the menue, you can find:
- **Stretch** -> to setup your stretching duration
- **Change** -> time to change position (can be zero)
- **Reputation** -> Number of Reputations. Timer will stop automatically. 0 means no auto. stop.
- **Vibrate** -> Notification by vibration*
- **Tone** -> Notification by sound*
