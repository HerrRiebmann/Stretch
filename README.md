# Stretch
Garmin MonkeyC App

### Application area:
Stretching is only effective, from about 30 seconds upwards.
To prevent contantly looking onto the watch, a timer will let you know when you can change the side.
Another timer allows you to change your position.

### Usage:
Start/Stop the timer by pressing "Enter" or "Start".
In the menue, you can find:
- **Stretch** -> to setup your stretching duration
- **Transition** -> time to change position/side/ect (can be zero)
- **Repetition** -> Number of repetitions. Timer will stop automatically. 0 means no auto. stop.
- **Recording** -> Record your activity and submit the intervals to Garmin Connect.
- **Vibrate** -> Notification by vibration*
- **Sound** -> Notification by tone*
- **Backlight** -> 3 Seconds backlight*
- **Autostart** -> Timer starts automatically
