# Stretch

To prevent contantly looking onto the watch, a timer will let you know when you can change the side.
Another timer allows you to change your position.

###Usage:
Start/Stop the timer by pressing "Enter" or "Start".
In the menue, you can find

- Durations -> Number of durations. Timer will stop automatically. 0 means no auto. stop.
- Vibrate -> Notification by vibration*
